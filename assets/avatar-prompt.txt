A vibrant digital art icon. A glowing icon of Nginx server logo, is being secured by a shining, metallic padlock emblem that symbolizes Certbot's logo. 
The entire composition is housed within a translucent, geometric blue Docker-style container, with its iconic whale logo visible. 
Streams of light are flowing into and out of the cube representing secure, encrypted data flow. The background is a black, clean gradient, 
making the logos elements pop. Tech-inspired, energetic, and modern.
